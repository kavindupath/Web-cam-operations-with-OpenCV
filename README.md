# Web-cam-operations-with-OpenCV
This is a simple demonstration of how to use webcam in OpenCV 

Here we use the computer camera to capture video and do few operation with OpenCv
First we create a VideoCapture Object in order to capture a video from camera
Its argument can be either the device index or the name of a video file. 
Device index is just the number to specify which camera.(here I used 0)

The content include how to read a new frame, to show the frame and how to exit the frame.

Also the code include how to flip the frame as well as how to draw a rectangle on top of the video frame

Latter include how to save sequence of frames in a array and preview thsoe frames.

You can read more about the functions of OpenCV in using cameras by refering the below links:
